Add scripts that plot output here! Also any style helper scripts 
you feel like making.

makePlot.py is a helper script for setting some default plot settings and 
displaying or saving plots. For an example of how to write a plotting
script that can be used with makePlot.py, see histogramLocalTime.py.
