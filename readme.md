Goals
-----

- Predict the response time of a tutor to a ping given data 
  associated with the ping (e.g. time sent, tutor's indicated
  availability status, etc.).
  
- Produce an algorithm for selecting the top N tutors most
  likely to respond to a request for help.
  
Organization
------------

All scripts should be run from the base directory.

*Data*
Local data files (raw and processed) should be located here
but not committed to the repository.

*Classes*
Class definitions to set up data structures, and scripts to 
read raw data from *.npy files and save in pandas DataFrames.

*Analysis*
Scripts for data processing and analysis.

*PlottingScripts*
Scripts for data visualization.

*PreliminaryAnalysis*
Scripts used for initial data exploration that are no longer being
maintained and should not be expected to run. Most of the code 
here is replicated in some form in one of the other directories.
